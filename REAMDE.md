# Design Teardown

This is the [Design Teardown project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/lessons/design-teardown) from [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [HTML and CSS Course.](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/)

The goal of the project was to break down a popular website into its design components, namely its visual hierarchy and typography.  
The visual hierarchy was represented with a 'heat map' composed of various shades of gray to represent the visual 'weight' of objects,
and the typography was approximated using [Google Fonts.](https://fonts.google.com/)
